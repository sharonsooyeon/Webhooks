            <h4>Takeaway</h4>
            <p>Participating in an orchestra in leadership positions poses the unique challenge of leading from within. As a section leader, I have to guide my violin section to listen to and collaborate with many other sections, while also following the guiding hand of the conductor. Though classical music has the unfortunate reputation of being an elitist activity, these experiences have taught me that many heads are always better than one, and leading as a member of the community is always more powerful than leading from ahead.</p>
