							<p class="description">In one of my <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/index.html">favorite courses</a> from college, my group members and I wrote a <a href="./6.805.pdf">final paper</a> analyzing how fake news has affected American politics, examining efforts made by private and public entities to curb its prevalence. We make recommendations on how to mitigate fake news with a particular emphasis on implementing a hypothetical encrypted system that would verify users&rsquo; identities, and discuss its implications on free speech and expression.

We performed &Delta;G calculations and charge optimizations on both the wild-type and mutant forms of chronic myeloid leukemia-treating drugs to evaluate their efficacy in electrostatic binding using computational methods that numerically solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. We used GROMACS, molecular dynamics simulation software, as our primary way of accomplishing this.</p> -->

	            <p class="description">I created and maintain <a href="https://genzcritics.com/" target="_blank">a website</a> for an organization started by my sister. Gen Z Critics is a platform where youth can connect about their passion for film criticism. I onboard new writers, publish new reviews, and create author profiles. Instead of using a hefty framework like Angular that is heavily dynamic and dependent on user interaction, I wrote my <a href="https://github.com/genzcritics/genzcritics.github.io" target="_blank">own Python script</a> for streamlining the process of publishing new content for this mostly static site (it is viewership-heavy rather than user interaction-heavy), so the process is mostly automated at this point.</p>

Using Ruby on Rails, I ensured the payment Gateway&rsquo;s forward compatibility with Elasticsearch 5.x. I also worked with a Rewinder that would catch data inconsistencies between output from Kafka, a data storage platform, to the Elasticsearch loader. I see this experience as my stepping stone to understanding how software companies operate.</p>

              <p>Participating in an orchestra poses the unique challenge of leading from within. Though I was frequently concertmaster, that job still means understanding that your violin section is a part of a greater whole, brought together by the baton of the conductor and the natural interplay between each section. Though classical music has the unfortunate reputation of being an elitist activity, these experiences have taught me that many heads are always better than one, and leading as a member of the community is more powerful than leading from ahead.</p> -->
