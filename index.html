            <p class="lead">Hi! My name is Sharon and I&#8217;m currently working at a software engineer in New York. I graduated from <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/" target="blank">Wellesley College</a> with a B.A. in computer science in 2018. Below, I&rsquo;ve delineated three crucial aspects of my life.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/" target="blank">Foundations of Internet Policy</a></h4>
            <p class="description">I think this is one of the <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/index.html" target="blank">best courses</a> I&#8217;ve ever taken. We wrote a <a href="./6.805.pdf" target="blank">final paper</a> analyzing how fake news has affected American politics, examining efforts made by private and public entities to curb its prevalence, discussing the legal implications of eliminating fake news, and making recommendations on how to mitigate it, with a particular emphasis on implementing a hypothetical encrypted system that would verify users&rsquo; identities. By the end of the semester, we managed to get our paper to be used as an &ldquo;exemplary paper&rdquo; by the course staff.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4><a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.S978/" target="blank">Privacy Legislation: Law and Technology</a></h4>
            <p class="description">This was a joint course with MIT and Georgetown Law School. The end-of-semester project culminated in presenting our legislative proposal to a panel of legislators and public policy experts in Washington, D.C. My group wrote the <a href="6.s978/Broadband_ISP_Privacy_Act_of_2018.pdf" target="blank">Broadband ISP Privacy Act of 2018</a>, an act that fosters competition among local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and provides consumers with meaningful choice about the collection and use of their private information. At the end of the semester, we won the &ldquo;Wildcard Award&rdquo;, one of two awards given to the class, for best <a href="6.s978/presentation.pdf" target="blank">presentation</a>.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/sharonsooyeon/twitter_polarization" target="blank">Polarization on Twitter</a></h4>
            <p class="description">In this project, I examine how millennials are interacting on Twitter in the polarized political arena in the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election. I accomplish this by scraping the conversations of young, politically active journalists and visualizing their conversations using LDA topic modeling. You can see the final paper and visualizations <a href="./twitter_polarization/index.html">here</a>.</p>

            <h4><a href="http://academics.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Radhakrishnan/index.html" target="blank">The Radhakrishnan Lab</a></h4>
            <p class="description">A computational chemistry lab at Wellesley College under the guidance of <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/chemistry/facultystaff/radhakrishnan" target="blank">Professor Mala Radhakrishnan</a>. We performed &Delta;G calculations and charge optimizations on both the wild-type and mutant forms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib" target="blank">chronic myeloid leukemia-treating drugs</a> to evaluate their efficacy in electrostatic binding using computational methods that numerically solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%E2%80%93Boltzmann_equation" target="blank">Poisson-Boltzmann equation</a>. We used <a href="http://www.gromacs.org/" target="blank">GROMACS</a>, molecular dynamics simulation software, as our primary way of accomplishing this.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://genzcritics.com/" target="blank">Gen Z Critics</a></h4>
            <p class="description">I created and maintain <a href="https://genzcritics.com/" target="blank">a website</a> for an organization started by my sister. Gen Z Critics is a platform where youth can connect about their passion for film criticism. I onboard new writers, publish new reviews, and create author profiles. Instead of using a hefty framework like Angular that is heavily dynamic and dependent on user interaction, I wrote my <a href="https://github.com/genzcritics/genzcritics.github.io" target="blank">own Python script</a> for streamlining the process of publishing new content for this mostly static site (it is viewership-heavy as opposed to user interaction-heavy), so the process is mostly automated at this point.</p>

            <h4><a href="up/project.html" target="blank">Up House</a></h4>
            <p class="description">A fun recreation of one of the iconic scenes from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/" target="blank">Up</a>, the 2009 Pixar film, which was the final project for my graphics course. This project demonstrates my visual meticulousness, but also my commitment to clean, organized, efficiently-implemented code.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/" target="blank">Braintree</a></h4>
            <p class="description">Using Ruby on Rails, I ensured the Braintree Gatewayâ€™s forward compatibility with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="blank">Elasticsearch 5.x</a>. I also worked with a Rewinder that would catch data inconsistencies between output from <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="blank">Kafka</a> to the Elasticsearch loader. I see this experience as my stepping stone to understanding how software companies operate (I&rsquo;ve only worked at two, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be too different.)</p>

            <h4 class="code"><a href="https://github.com/sharonsooyeon/shell" target="blank"><code>bash</code> shell</a></h4>
            <p class="description">A simple <code>bash</code> <a href="https://github.com/sharonsooyeon/shell" target="blank">shell</a>, which was the final project for my introduction to systems with laboratory course. This is the course that changed the way I think about computers in general, how computers think about numbers, and how computers execute tasks.</p>

            <h4><a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/HLT/HLT.html" target="blank">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a></h4>
            <p class="description">Lincoln Lab is a federally funded R&amp;D center, affiliated with MIT. I was <em>briefly</em> a member of Lincoln Lab&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/mission/cybersec/HLT/HLT.html" target="blank">Group 52</a> data-driven discovery of models (D3M). Under Group 52, I constructed a machine learning pipeline for an audio data set.</p>

              <p class="description"><a href="https://launch.carnegiehall.org/nyousaprofile/2014/sharonkim/" target="blank">I was the 2nd principal violinist</a> in this ensemble&#8217;s 2014 residency and tour. It is a free program sponsored by the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/" target="blank">Bloomberg Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.carnegiehall.org/" target="blank">Carnegie Hall</a>.

              <p class="description">I was the concertmaster violinist of HCO&#8217;s 2016 production of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rake%27s_Progress" target="blank">The Rake&#8217;s Progress</a>, an opera by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky" target="blank">Stravinsky</a>.</p>

            	<h4><a href="http://web.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Live/HonorsConcertProgram2016.pdf" target="blank">Wellesley College Honors Concerts</a></h4>
              <p>I am a three-time participant in the annual Wellesley College Honors Concerts, until my senior year, when I decided to switch over to piano.</p>
              <h4>Takeaway</h4>
              <p>Participating in an orchestra in leadership positions poses the unique challenge of leading from within. As a section leader, I have to guide my violin section to listen to and collaborate with many other sections, while also following the guiding hand of the conductor. Though classical music has the unfortunate reputation of being an elitist activity, these experiences have taught me that many heads are always better than one, and leading as a member of the community is always more powerful than leading from ahead.</p>
