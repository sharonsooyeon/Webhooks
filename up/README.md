## Description
For our final project, we decided to recreate one of the iconic scenes from Up (http://www.pickchur.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/pixar-up-house.png), the 2009 Pixar film about the adventures of a widowed, elderly man and his young companion.

Our project exhibits many different important CG concepts, including:
  1) Hierarchical modeling
  2) Material and lighting
  3) Bezier surfaces
  4) Textures and texture-mapping
  5) Transparency
  6) Animation
